        <h1>Tamagne Gedefaye</h1>
        <h3>And I'm a <span>Frontend Developer</span></h3>
        <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Tamagne, and I'm a passionate front-end website developer. I specialize in creating beautiful, user-friendly websites that not only look great but also deliver a seamless user experience.

            I have always been fascinated by the power of the web to connect people, spark creativity, and facilitate communication. For me, front-end development is not just a job, it's a way of life. I love getting lost in the details of code, experimenting with new design techniques, and solving complex problems that require both creativity and technical expertise.</p>

            <h3>Fronted Developer</h3>
            <P>Hello, my name is Tamagne Gedefaye and I am a student of Electro Mechanical Engineering at Addis Ababa Science and Technology University. Although my studies focus on the physical aspects of engineering, I have always had a strong interest in software engineering as well, particularly in front-end software development.

                As someone who values creativity and design, I find front-end development to be an exciting and rewarding field. I enjoy the process of bringing a website or application to life through carefully crafted user interfaces and engaging user experiences. In my spare time, I have been studying HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to hone my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and best practices.
                
                I believe that my background in engineering gives me a unique perspective on software development, and I am excited to explore the intersection of these two fields. I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer, and I am eager to contribute my skills to projects that make a positive impact on the world.
            </P>
